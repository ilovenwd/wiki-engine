Wiki Engine
===========

Wiki Engine is a Rails Engines powered plugin, that allows you to add a wiki to your Rails App in a breeze.

It is currently an early prototype and an experiment on how to play with Rails Engines and Git, so use it at your own risk.

Requirements
------------

To use Wiki Engine you need the following:

* Rails <= 2.3
* Grit
* BlueCloth


Install
-------

Simply run:

> script/plugin install git://github.com/SagMor/wiki-engine.git
> 
> rake wiki:repository:create

And you should be ready to roll

Simply access

> http://localhost:3000/wiki/en/

And see the welcome page!

TODO
----

* Write Tests (Sorry but i still need to make the habit)
* Add I18N
* Implement Cool Wiki features (Diff, History, Blame, etc)
* Support better integration with arbitrary Rails App
